    <img src="./image/assassincreed.jpg" class="mx-auto d-block">
    <div> Ancient Egypt, a land of majesty and intrigue, is disappearing in a ruthless fight for power. Unveil dark secrets and forgotten myths as you go back to the one founding moment: The Origins of the Assassin’s Creed</div><br>
    <div>As compared to the other seasons of Assassin’s Creed, Origins for PC have a bigger and more open map for the player to explore but uses an Elder Scrolls-like compass bar that directs the player in the direction of quests and objects of interest. Send, Bayek’s companion for the eagle plays the role of “Eagle Vision” of the game and is used to detect and mark enemies. The aerial perspective also allows players to locate treasure chests, create resources and hidden passages. In addition, Senu can be upgraded to distract or attack enemies. If you use Senu, no part of the map will fog. The player must go himself in the fogged area of ​​the map to scramble. The interiors are accessible and the library of Alexandria can be explored. Although it lacks the traditional “Eagle Vision”, it has “Animus Pulse”, which only showcases objects.</div><br>
    <div>Assassin’s Creed Origins Pc Game also moves away from the mission structure of previous entries in the franchise and instead uses quests that the open-world player needs to pick up, and then pursue them as they please, without desynchronizing them.
      The overheating of the desert is another RPG element introduced with Origins. Basically, players can develop heatstroke if they stay in the desert for too long. The system introduces different effects depending on the severity of the desert overheating.</div><br>
